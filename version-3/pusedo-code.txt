ðŸ§  VERSION 3 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET 
-------------------------------------

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve? 
   What kind of HTTP request do we need to send, and to what API endpoint? 
   If we are sending a POST request, what do we need to send in the request body, and what is the data type? 
   What would we get back in the response, and what is the data type? 
  
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data? 
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page? 

3. WHERE does this happen in the code? 
   What component, page or function? 

4. HOW do we accomplish this? 
   What steps do we need to take? 
   Do we need to...
    - make any GET or POST requests to an API endpoint? 
    - render anything in JSX? 
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions? 
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks? 
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet â€” just outline the actions in plain language. 

âœ¨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.
