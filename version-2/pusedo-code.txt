:brain: VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
-------------------------------------
This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:
1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   List the key/value pair, data type, example value.
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?
3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?
4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
    - render anything in JSX?
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
    - set or get an item from localStorage?
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet — just outline the actions in plain language.
:sparkles: YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.
------------------------
:bar_chart: FORM DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "user"
VALUE: (the data from the form that the user submits) fullname, email, country, bio 
VALUE DATA TYPE: object with key values 
EXAMPLE VALUE: 
{
   name: "bob smith"
   email: bobsmith@gmail.com
   country: Argentina 
   bio: loves fish 
}
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: 
STORING FORM DATA
------------------------
WHEN: when user hits submit 
WHERE: saved countries page
HOW:
Step 1: create a handle submit function that includes saving it into localStorage 
Step 2: We add the handleSubmit as an OnSubmit prop ont he form in JSX- make sure that the function is being called when the user clicks submit
Step 3: _______
Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: RETRIEVING FORM DATA 
when you use ***getItem
------------------------
WHEN: When the user loads the saved countries page
WHERE: Saved countries page above the form
HOW:
Step 1: We need to make a useEffect that retrieves the Form data on page load and saves it in state 
Step 2: We render the state variable in the JSX  as a heading that says "Welcom [user]"
Step 3: _______
Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:bar_chart: SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "savedCountries"
VALUE: the page will have an array of saved country names or the value of the saved country
VALUE DATA TYPE: array of strings 
EXAMPLE VALUE: [
Finland, Jamaica, USA
]

------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHEN: when a user clicks the save country button on the country details page 
WHERE: this will happen on the country details page on the detail-countryInfo child of the detail-container 
HOW:
Step 1: on save the code will look at the "savedCountries" list on local storage   
Step 2: then use an if conditional: if the list is empty and the exsisting country is not there then add to the list as an object else don't add 
Step 3: then you have to convert the info into stringified information and store it locally to the JSON list 

_______Below is the class notes______
Step 1: We need to attach an onClick handler to the Save button on the COuntryDetail page  
Step 2: When the user clicks on teh Save button call teh handleClock function 
Step 3: the handleClick function needs to save the country's name in localStorage  
Step 4: 
The handleClick function will first get the array of saved countries from local Storage. 
If the country is already saved, then there is no need to save the country. If the country is not saved yet, then add the country's name to the array of savedCountries and store that value in localStorage.

------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHEN: when teh user clicks on the saved countries page using useEffect
WHERE: savedcountries using the info from localStorage 
HOW:
Step 1: using useEffect we can run the savedcountries information when the savedCountries page loads 
Step 2: The coputer has to then get the information of the saved conutries from the local storage and display it back to the user 
Step 3: but the list of saved countries into a state variable 
Add more steps as needed!

_______Below is the class notes______
Step 1: Make a useEffect that runs on page load it will.... 
Step 2: Get the array of savedCountries from localStorage 
Step 3: Store it in a state variable  
Step 4: Render the state variable in JSX as countryCards.
------------------------
:bar_chart: COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: the countries name 
VALUE: (the variable that holds the number) country's viewCount as a Numberevery
VALUE DATA TYPE: number 
EXAMPLE VALUE:
  5

------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
------------------------
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a country’s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.
WHEN: each time a Country's country Detail page opens (on page visit) 
WHERE: CountryDetail
HOW:
Step 1: create a useState for the viewCOunt When the page loads use useEffect to look at the countryViewCounts on the local storage (if it's blank then it will have an empty object)
Step 2: useEffect t0:
   1. retreave the current viewCOunt 
      2. then add one 
   3. then store the new number in local storage
Step 3:update the value of the viewCount using setViewCount 
Step 4: show it back to the user  by rendering it in the JSX
